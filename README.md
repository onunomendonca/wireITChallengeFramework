# wireITChallenge - String Framework
The “StringServiceSDK” folder contains the library, including the fully documented source code, tests, and build files, as well as the .xcframework.

The “ServiceStringApp” folder contains an application that uses the “StringServiceSDK” framework via the .xcframework, which was copied into the application folder for easier access. In a real application, we would only use this .xcframework to protect the code, as requested in the exercise. In this app, you can see the screen where the string is being sent, followed by a success message if the string was successfully sent or an error message if something went wrong.
